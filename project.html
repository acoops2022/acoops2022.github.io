        <h1>Project</h1>

        <h3>Aim</h3>
        
        <p>This project aims to evaluate some common economic promises made by the conservative party in their 2010, 2015 and 2019 manifestos using data. 
            Using python, I counted the most frequent words in the manifestos in ascending order. Click <a
            href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14PdIr2Z0wyArIY49JfB_4yXq_rnCC8J1" id="link1"> here</a> to see my google collab. After reading the 
            manifestos I decided to test the commitments on the following categories. Macroeconomic promises on reducing the budget deficit, taxation, 
            improving GDP growth and increasing employment. Investment promises to the NHS and redistribute investment around the UK. The project aims to
            take a neutral political stance and evaluate whether the conservative party achieved their pledges using data.  </p>


        <h3>12 Years of the Conservative party</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"> </div>
        <p>This chart provides an overview of the last five general election results. It visualises the percentage of the popular vote each party 
            received. In 2010 the UK had a coalition government with David Cameron as the leader of the Conservative party and Nick Clegg as the leader 
            of the Liberal Democrats. After the 2015 general election, the Conservative party remained in power with several party leadership changes 
            after David Cameron resigned. The data for this chart was scraped from Wikipedia using python. To see how click <a

        <h3>Taxation and Debt</h3>
        <div class="chart-grid2">
            <div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart6"> </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>A major commitment of the Conservative manifestos was to improve Britain’s international tax competitiveness, not raise VAT and National 
            Insurance tax and reduce the budget deficit. The left chart shows the corporation tax cuts the Conservative party introduced and its effect 
            on corporation tax it received. This graph demonstrates the Conservative party’s policy of trickle-down economics and Arthur Laffre’s theory 
            because lowering corporation tax encouraged investment and increased tax revenue. Thus, achieving one aspect of the taxation pledges. The 
            right chart shows the conservative government successfully reducing the budget deficit while overall nominal debt increased at the same rate 
            as GDP. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic undermined these efforts. </p>
        
        <p>Analysis of VAT and NIC became too complex to visualise due to effective rates depending on many variables and irregular policy changes 
            between 2020-2022. I initially tried to source the data through Trading Economics API, however it required an expensive subscription for 
            historical data. Therefore, I copied the data into a csv file along with data from gov.uk.</p>

        <h3>Labour Market and GDP growth</h3>
        
        <div class="chart" id="Chart7"> </div>
        
        <p>The creation of jobs and increased employment was an essential part of all three manifestos and was often mentioned in unison of increasing GDP. 
            The chart shows four variables of the labour market and GDP growth that all suggest the conservative party upheld their promises to some degree
            except for in 2020. Data on the number of jobs created through government investment is not available making precise fact-checking impossible.</p>
        
        <p>I attempted to use multiple ONS APIs to link timeseries data between the ONS and Vega-lite so that the chart would update. However, it proved too 
            complicated and time consuming so I resorted to downloading the data sets from the ONS and cleaning it in excel.</p>

        <h3>NHS expenditure and productivity</h3>
        <div class="chart-grid2">
            <div class="column" class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>
            <div class="column" class="chart" id="Chart4"></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>
        
        <p>All manifestos promised increased NHS spending. These three charts look at whether promises were upheld and whether quality and productivity of 
            the NHS has been maintained.</p>
        
        <p>The first chart shows NHS spending has increased consistently since 2010. Expenditure as a percentage of GDP has remained constant until 2020.</p>
        
        <p>The second chart is a time series of NHS productivity and productivity growth rate. Productivity is calculated by dividing Outputs by its Inputs. 
            Outputs and Inputs are indexed at 1995 values. Overall, the graph shows that NHS productivity has continued to grow at a constant rate. </p>
        
        <p>The third chart visualise the growth rate of the components of inputs and outputs of the NHS. The most difficult part of visualising this was 
            cleaning the data set and converting it into long form data.</p>
        
        <p>Overall, the government met its promises to increase spending on the NHS. However, the 2019 manifesto promises are undetermined yet but information 
            on projections can be found <a

        <h3>Levelling up Britain</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart8"> </div>
        <p>Another common promise among the manifestos was to redistribute wealth from London to the rest of the UK through 
            investment. This chart is a map of the UK regions. The more red the region the large the amount of government 
            investment the region received. If you move the slider from 2010 to 2021 you can see that there has been little 
            variation in investment across the UK, with London receiving the most investment. This demonstrates an 
            unsubstantiated promise.</p>
        
        <p>The data used for this chart was sourced from the ONS. Click <a

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        
        <p>This project was never going to be comprehensive evaluation of the Conservative party’s Economic legacy. Its true aim is to demonstrate the 
            importance of being able to hold your Government’s promises to account. That is to be able to measure the effect of policies and clearly 
            communicate it to the public in an unbiased way. The project looked at macroeconomic data to access promises in Conservative manifestos. The 
            data suggests the government was relatively faithful in its tax, employment and NHS promises but not faithful to its promises on tackling 
            inequality and levelling up Britain. </p>
