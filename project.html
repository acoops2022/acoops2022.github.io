        <h3>Aim</h3>
        
        <p>This project aims to evaluate some common economic objectives and promises made by the conservative party in their 2010, 2015 and 2019 
            manifestos using data. Using python, I read the three manifestos and counted the most frequent words in ascending order. click <a
            href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14PdIr2Z0wyArIY49JfB_4yXq_rnCC8J1" id="link1"> here</a> to 
            see my google collab. After sifting through article words, I found the following: ‘tax’ appeared 292 times, ‘business’ 188 times, ‘invest’ 
            182 times, ‘economy’ 142 times and ‘NHS’ 118 times. After, reading the manifestos I have decided to test the commitments on the following 
            categories. Macroeconomic promises on reducing the budget deficit, improving GDP growth and increasing employment. Investment promises 
            to the improve the NHS redistribute around the UK. This project aims to take a neutral political stance and purely evaluate whether the 
            conservative party achieved their pledges on a yes or no basis. </p>


        <h3>12 Years of the Conservative party</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"> </div>
        <p>This first chart provides an overview of the last five general election results. It presents the percentage of the popular vote each party 
            received after general elections. In 2010 the UK had a coalition government with David Cameron as the leader of the Conservative party and 
            Nick Clegg as the leader of the Liberal Democrats. After the 2015 general election, the Conservative party has remained in power with a 
            number of party leadership changes. After losing the EU referendum David Cameron resigned on 24th June 2016, being the last Conservative PM 
            to serve a full term to this date. Theresa May, Borris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have all served as PM under the Conservative party 
            since. The data for this chart was scraped from Wikipedia and collated using python. To see how click  <a

        <h3>Taxation</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div>
        <p>A major commitment of the Conservative manifestos was to improve Britain’s international tax competitiveness and not raise VAT and National Insurance tax. 
            The chart above shows the corporation tax cuts the Conservative party introduced and its effect on corporation tax received by HMRC. The graph demonstrates
            the Conservative party’s policy of trickle-down economics and the Laffre curve (1974) because by lowering corporation tax they encouraged entrepreneurship 
            and increased tax revenue. Therefore, they achieved one aspect of their taxation pledges. </p>
        
        <p>However, UK tax system is complex and raising or lowering one rate impacts the benefits and incentives of others. Furthermore, analysis became too complex 
            to visualise when looking at data for VAT and NI rate changes due to the effective rate depending on many variables. It should be noted that VAT was 
            raised from 17.5% to 20% in Jan 2011 but during COVID-19 was lowered to 5% and then raised to 12.5% for certain sectors. NI rate was also raised and then 
            reversed during 2022.</p>
        
        <p>I initially tried to source the data through Trading Economics API, however it required an expensive subscription for historical data. Therefore, I copied 
            the data into a csv file along with data from gov.uk.</p>

        <h3>Levelling up Britain</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart8"> </div>
        <p>Another common promise among the manifestos was to redistribute wealth from London to the rest of the UK through 
            investment. This chart is a map of the UK regions. The more red the region the large the amount of government 
            investment the region received. If you move the slider from 2010 to 2021 you can see that there has been little 
            variation in investment across the UK, with London receiving the most investment. This demonstrates an 
            unsubstantiated promise.</p>

        <h3>IMF lending Outstanding GDP adjusted</h3>

        <div class="chart" id="Chart6"> </div>
        <p>The sixth chart looks at the amount of outstanding loan by the IMF as a percentage of world GDP. When the
            chart is
            adjusted this way I conclude that 1984-1985 were the most risky years because they have the highest IMF loan
            outstanding as a percentage of world GDP. </p>
